# Monty-Hall-problem

This a rough  python script that illustrates the problem with a graph. 
There is a panel with three doors (here generalized to a number >= 3) and behind one of them a prize. The player chooses
a door. But before this door is opened the moderator opens one of the other doors to an empty cell.
The player is then given the opportunity to switch his/her choice to one of the remaining doors. This is entire process 
is repeated as defined by the num_guesses.  A plot is generated for the two options: the player keeps or  
switches the original guessed door.
